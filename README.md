# SONAlgorithm-MarketBasketAnalysis--DataMining

# Project Overview

Implement the SON algorithm using the Apache Spark Framework. You will use three different datasets, ranging from very small to very large. This will help you to test, develop and optimize your algorithm given the number of records at hand.
The goal of this assignment is to make you understand how you can apply the frequent itemset algorithms like Apriori on a large number of data and more importantly how you can make your implementation more performant and efficient in a distributed environment.
